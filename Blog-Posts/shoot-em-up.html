          <p>
            For this "Shoot 'Em Up" game jam prompt, our group decided to make a
            game where you play as an exterminator going into the sewers to tame
            the increasingly bad rat problem. As you do, the rats become
            increasingly strange with some of them in boats, planes or even
            mechanical suits.
          </p>
          <p>
            This game had two coders working on it, as a result the code work
            was split between the two of us. We decided to make the game in
            Unity, an engine I have not used before, however, the other
            developer was very experienced in it. Because of this, the workload
            was split so that I would do the more beginner friendly tasks as the
            other coder had massively more experience than me. This resulted in
            my task being the Game Menu and Pause screen.
          </p>
          <h3>Menu Design</h3>
          <img src="images/lorumipsum.png" alt="lorum ipsum Screenshot" />
          <p>
            The First iteration of the menu. Each button changes colour when
            hovered over and when clicked.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, the buttons change colour when hovered and clicked,
            but they do not do anything once clicked. Therefore, a C# code was
            needed to link the buttons to new scenes. I created two placeholder
            scenes (one for play and one for options) and added them to a
            hierarchy of scenes.
          </p>
          <pre><code>using System.Collections;
        using System.Collections.Generic;
        using UnityEngine;
        using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
        
        public class MainMenu : MonoBehaviour
        {
            public void PlayGame()
            {
                SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("test1"); //Loads next scene
                Debug.Log("PLAY GAME!");
                //SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex + 1); //Loads next scene
            }
        
            public void GameOptions()
            {
                Debug.Log("OPTIONS MENU");
                SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex + 2);
                //SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("Options");
            }
        
            public void QuitGame()
            {
                Debug.Log("QUIT GAME!");
                Application.Quit();
            }
        }        
        </code></pre>
          <p>
            Then using this, a C# code needed a function for each button which
            called the new scene. This can be done in two ways as shown by the
            code above. In the end I used the hierarchal way of calling them as
            the scenes I were using were place holders and so it made more sense
            to reference them by build index so we wouldn't have to change the
            code when linking it to the other coders work as long as it was in
            the same place in the build index.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once coded, this needs to be linked to the buttons themselves.
            Therefore it is attached to the MainMenu game object that the
            buttons are in. Then, it is dragged into OnClick() in the button and
            the appropriate function is called for each button. This resulted in
            A fully working menu that changed the scene on a button press.
          </p>
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            On reflection, this was a good way to ease myself into Unity, and
            coding C# for the first time. It helped me to learn the syntax of C#
            so that in future I would have a good understanding of the basic
            syntax of the language meaning less syntax errors in future. This
            will help me to more easily create more complicated code in future.
