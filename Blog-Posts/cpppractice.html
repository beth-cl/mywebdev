            As a way of practicing my C++ coding I decided to do a simple
            project of creating a text based noughts and crosses game. By doing
            this, I can learn to utilise arrays and classes as well as practice
            my syntax as I have encountered many errors due to syntax.

          </code>
          <p>
            For this short project I used a tutorial (Geeks For Geeks n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>
            The first part of the code has two classes. Classes are important
            because it helps the code to be more organised and efficient as the
            class is only used when called, it is also useful for if you wanted
            to create subclasses from that class to use its functions or
            variables. The first class uses two for loops to print the layout of
            the board while using the 3D array that stores the board entries to
            check what should be printed where. The second class checks the 3D
            Array to see if you have got 3 identical characters in the right
            places.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main loop of the game uses a for loop to make sure that the
            number of turns does not exceed the number of spaces in the array.
            as well as handling user inputs and calling the classes coded.
          </p>
          <h3>Debugging and commenting</h3>
          <p>
            After following their code, I came across many compiler errors.
            However, before I went into debugging the code, I went about
            properly understanding what I had written (Nystrom 2009). I did this
            through going through and commenting instructions on what is going
            on in the code. Effective commenting can be used to give high level
            explanations while keeping low-level knowledge to the code itself.
            (Hunt & Thomas, 1999)
          </p>
          <p>
            By going through the code and commenting it I was able to find the
            syntax error in my code that was preventing it from running. Another
            reason for me doing this is that it makes the code easier for other
            coders to use and read as it shows them exactly what all the code
            does.
          </p>
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            By coding this simple game I was able to help myself learn C++ in an
            applied setting. This helped me a lot with learning more of the
            operators (such as || and ?:)that can be used in C++ which I will
            now be able to properly utilise in future projects. This was also
            useful in giving experience in multi-dimensional arrays That can be
            used in future to store data in tables. For example, I could use a
            multi-dimensional array to store the names and dialogues of NPCs in
            a game and then access that when interacting with them. One thing I
            would Like to do with this code in future would be to add code that
            would mean the players could choose columns/rows 1, 2 or 3 rather
            than 0, 1 or 2 as I think that would produce better user experience.
            To achieve this I would most likely take the row and col variables
            -that would be 1, 2 or 3- and subtract 1 form them before accessing
            that part of the array.
