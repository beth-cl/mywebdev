            Space Pigeon was the first game I made in Unreal Engine 5 with a
            group of people. This was made for the Platformer prompt we were
            given for this Game Jam. Making this I had to take more of a lead
            programmer role, where I worked on the menu, character movements,
            enemy movements and level changes. I enjoyed this project as I was
            able to code what would be the fundamentals for a lot of games and
            so I'd be able to use what I'd learnt a lot in future projects.
          </p>
          <h3>Blueprint Programming</h3>
          <p>
            In this project, I worked primarily with blueprints. One thing I
            made sure to do was use comments to label all the different
            sections. This improved my blueprints' readability and makes it
            easier for other programmers to quickly know what it does. As well
            as this, I made sure to use, I used custom events because it keeps
            the code a lot neater and can help to simplify the wire network of
            the graph. (Epic Games, n.d.)
          </p>
          <p>
            One frustrating part of this project was the enemy AIs. They were
            very simple, they simply had to move from left to right on platforms
            and once hit the game would end. But I came across many issues, such
            as them walking off platforms or not walking far enough. To fix this
            within the time constrains of the game jam, I placed objects to stop
            them from walking off because as long as there was an object in
            there line of view they would stop as intended. So in future, I
            would like to work on my implementation of enemy AI movements. For
            example, one thing I should have done is to create a base class for
            the enemy AI movements, then I could have the different distance of
            AI movements as different child classes to that one parent class.
            This would have been very easy to implement too as the movement
            speed is set by a variable that could be different for each class.
