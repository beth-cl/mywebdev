      For our first game jam our prompt was a “hyper-casual one button game”. I
      decided to use this first simple game jam as an opportunity to explore
      Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) as I wanted to improve my knowledge in blueprint
      coding to better help me with the CSGO module in future. In hindsight, I
      feel that Unity may have been a better engine to make Stare in, as it is
      more suited to 2D environments than UE5, even if they are both 3D engines.

    <h3>First draft and prototyping</h3>

    <p>
      Before making the game, I decided to prototype it in scratch. This is
      because Scratch gives a very straightforward way to think about the code
      which will then help me better understand what I need to do in the final
      version of the game.

      As I had never used Unreal before, starting from absolute scratch without
      any research or tutorials would have not ended well. Because of this, I
      found three videos that I intended to use for the game, but of which I
      only used two. The first video was a video on how to make a basic clicker
      (UE5 BP GURU, 2023), I followed this, which helped me to understand Unreal
      a lot better than my previous understanding. As a one button clicker game
      has limited capabilities in being unique I decided to use a flip flop to
      change the image of the button when pressed. For this I used a video that
      showed an alternation between two images (KeySmash Studios, 2020) and used
      my own knowledge to alter it to alternate between four, this was done by
      setting the button image to a new image depending on whether the button
      was pressed or not pressed.

    <h3>Packaging and issues</h3>
    <p>
      Most of the issues that came with this code come from packaging the file.
      At first the game did not have a package at all, of which I found out that
      the problem was where I had attempted to change the toolbar widget for
      Stare from the default Unreal logo to an unused 5th piece of button art.
      However in doing this, It caused the packaging to crash each time. By
      reverting it back to the default it was able to package again. However,
      once packaged, another problem presented itself as you could not press the
      button. After looking into why I had this issue, I realised it was because
      I had originally set up this game as a mobile game and so now when opening
      the game it does not work with mouse press, and only works with
      touchscreen. These are mistakes that can easily be fixed and won't be
      repeated in future.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      In reflection, Stare has given me a good amount of technical challenges
      for a first project while still being able to create a finished project. I
      got to use a large amount of important techniques for UE5 for the first
      time, like using functions for the text bindings and casting blueprints to
      utilise variables in other places. My goals of improvements after this
      game would be to build upon the foundations of what I have learnt in this
      game to create better blueprints in future.
