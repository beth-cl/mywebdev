      To start with, I coded a menu screen. This is because I haven't used UE5
      in a while and wanted to start with something to help get me back into the
      mindset of blueprint programming. This was relatively easy, by attaching a
      widget blueprint with the title, buttons and background to the level
      blueprint. One problem I encountered was where once the scene changed from
      the title to the first person pre-set, movement would stop working.
      However this problem didn't occur from running the pre-set by itself. To
      fix this I realised that I had to set the code to Set input mode UI only,
      this meant that when the scene switched the game wouldn't receive inputs.
      I fixed this by adding a Set Input mode Game only block to the On Clicked
      function for the play button.
    </p>

      The next thing I worked on was the Lifts that I used around the main Play
      area. This went smoothly apart from Near the very end where the lift
      wasn't moving but I couldn't figure out why. The reason was that I was
      using the the scene components instead of the billboard components when
      getting the world locations for top and bottom. This stopped the lift from
      moving as the scene components hadn't moved, it was the billboard
      components that had. After that, the lift worked as expected in my code.
      Coding this I used a Time Blueprint block and a float track. by using it
      here, I see how it could also be used for things like AI movements in
      future projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created a child class from this lift class for a lift that is spawned
      when 10 or more points have been collected. This lift was the same as the
      original lift apart for the size of the platform and the distance of the
      top billboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having this lift as a child class dramatically decreased the amount of
      code needed in this blueprint, massively reducing redundancy in the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then decided to work on a point system. The meshes of these were very
      simple, with just a spherical static mesh and a collision capsule.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used the same point spawner blueprint for both single and double point
      spheres. However, the difference between their spawn events is that single
      points spawn on a set timer of every 7 seconds, meanwhile double points
      spawn on a random time between 14 and 60 seconds. One syntax error that I
      had a problem with was not ticking the Looping boolean on the Set timer by
      event block, this meant that the point would only spawn once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used a print score string in this code to help with debugging so that I
      could check that as the points were being collected and being added to the
      Score variable that was being retrieved from another blueprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way I could have improved my code is by making the double points
      sphere a child class of the single point sphere. This would have made the
      code a lot more efficient and there would have been less redundant code in
      the double point blueprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a simple AI to follow the player in this game. This AI slowly
      increased in speed with the amount of points scored.
    </p>
    <p>
      This code -although effective- could be more efficient by using a switch
      case as switch statements only read the case you need unlike these if
      statements where they are all read whether they are needed or not. This
      would both dramatically shorten the code and reduce the amounts of pin
      links needed, making the code look a lot neater and a lot less like
      spaghetti code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making blueprints have a Play Sound 2D block in their codes was very
      useful when it came to the debugging process because it meant that I could
      easily tell which parts of blueprints had errors by what sounds were and
      weren't playing or were playing when they were not meant to.
