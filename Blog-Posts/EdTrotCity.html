          <p>
            For the 2024 University of Portsmouth Game Jam, I decided to
            collaborate with two other students to create the game Edtrotcity; a
            simple game where you play as Berquine the Dog Trot (half dog, half
            horse), who just wants to be an artist. After finding the sentient
            bust of Ernest B. Hay, Berquine has set out to capture the
            not-so-famous lawyer's portrait in hopes that he may share the hay
            that the statue so obviously promises, despite the struggle he faces
            thanks to his colour blindness.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this game jam, we had 4 days to create a game in our group of
            three, with 1 artist and 2 programmers, with me as the only person
            with games development experience. Because of this, my role was not
            only to be a programmer, but also a designer and a producer, to help
            lead this project to be successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we first decided was especially important was not to over
            scope. As we only had 4 days, and a very small team, it was
            important to make our goals clear and to make sure that everyone was
            aware of their roles and responsibilities. The first day of
            development was dedicated to this, which made development for the 3
            days much smoother.
          </p>
          <p>
            The subsequent few days were then focussed on development. By
            utilising both in person and online communication throughout
            development, it meant that all parts of the team were on the same
            page. Any new assets that were needed were quickly discussed and
            created with important input from both the programmers and the
            artists to make sure that the asset is not only practical for the
            task but also fitting the aesthetic of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my most important pushes and parts of development was
            exporting the game to WebGL for itch.io’s play in browser. This was
            because the games intended play time is only a few minutes and so it
            didn’t make sense from a design standpoint to for a player to
            download the full game when their playtime may not even be as long
            as the download time itself. This was a stretch goal, however, I
            found it to be a very important one. Exporting to WebGL meant a lot
            of changes to UI would need to be made as the layout of a WebGL
            window and a full application are different. Thanks to this major
            final push, our game was executable not only on Windows and iOS but
            also in browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the constant communication and mutual input throughout
            development this game jam was the smoothest I have ever participated
            in. However, due to the short span of this event, we did not have
            much time for testing, as a result, most of our user feedback on the
            game came at the showcase itself. Our main criticism came from the
            colour picking mechanism that often-confused players as it worked on
            a cycle. Instead, players were trying to click their desired colour
            on the easel asset. This provided really useful input into how
            things that we had put as stretch goals, like specific colour
            changes, should have been in the main goals, or a more urgent
            stretch goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all, our teams work paid off with us being awarded the award for
            both best art and best design at the UoP Game Jam awards ceremony.
            This was extremely rewarding to our team, as a group who primarily
            had not worked in games before. Working in this group has further
            solidified my excitement in working in teams of varieties of people
            to promote new ideas and makes me so excited for next year, and how
            our independent lines of study and work will divulge to create
            unique games in 2025.
