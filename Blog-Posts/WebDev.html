          <p>
            Making this website was my summer project between second and third
            year, it is coded from scratch in pure HTML and CSS and was my first
            time learning web development. Learning this was extremely rewarding
            experience that boosted my knowledge in many ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since my work experience at Speech Link, I have not properly
            divulged into HTML and CSS. However, this summer, I decided that my
            simple WordPress website didn’t represent me, my skill level, and
            who I am as both a creative and a programmer. Therefore, I took the
            initiative to create a website, with the help of Mozilla
            documentation articles and reaching out to other programmers who
            specialised in web development. As well as that, I researched into
            Graphic design aspects like typography and colour theory to because
            I felt the website shouldn’t only represent my accomplishments, but
            also my personality, so it can stand out among the crowds of other
            websites that employers will see.
          </p>
          <h3>The Process:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Design and Concept</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I used Canva to explore colours, fonts and layouts so that
                  when I got to programming the style sheet, I would know
                  exactly what I would want to create.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Index</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I’d create the basic HTML for my website a section at a
                  time, updating the stylesheet with each section so that the
                  correct class IDs would be added to each section.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blog Page</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Once the main index was complete, I moved onto the blog
                  page. This page was fairly simple as there were not as many
                  new CSS classes needed as it reused a lot from the index.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Individual Blog Posts</b>
              <ul>
                Each blog has its own individual html file. This file then
                uses style elements reused from the index and the main blog
                page.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Future Development</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Throughout this project I have highly enjoyed learning web
                  development and want to continue to improve this website
                  through the rest of my studies and beyond.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One of the things I would like to improve is the formats of
                  the websites. Instead of each of them being their own HTML
                  file, I would like to improve them to each be .Json files
                  instead. This will drastically decrease their file sizes,
                  meaning the pages will load quicker and it will be easier to
                  create new blogs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another thing I would like to do with this website is use
                  it to explore programming in JavaScript. By doing this, I
                  would not only be improving the overall quality of my website
                  but also, I would be improving my volatility as a programmer.
