            In this project I coded the shopfront. This had 5 features: a random
            customer sprite, randomised request texts, a to do board that
            appears and disappears with a button press that has 6 random order
            slots and a simple temporary drag potion code that was used while I
            didn't have access to the other coders inventory system.
          </p>
          <code><pre></pre></code>
          <p>
            This is the drag potion code. I also used it to store all the
            randomisers in the same place. I stored all my randomisers in the
            same place because all of the randomisers are triggered by the
            correct potion being given to the customer and so by doing this here
            I can link all the other scripts to this one which is a lot neater
            and creates a lot less redundancies than if it is done in their
            respective codes. I struggled with coding this due to the complexity
            of so many different files needing different variables and so this
            is where visualising my data was very beneficial. Doing it this way
            is also supported by the concept of "separation of concerns" which
            is a design principle that describes how software is divided into
            modules based off the functionality they perform. (Halpern, 2019)
          </p>
          <p>
            I had an issue with the code randomising to the same sprite twice in
            a row. To fix it I added a while loop that checked to see if the new
            random number and current random number are the same and if they
            are, to get a new random number, until the two numbers are
            different.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used a for loop to randomise the potion asked for on the order
            board. This made it more efficient than having to make a different
            switch case for each of the orders.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            To draft my code during this project I used flowcharts a lot. This
            helped to give me a better insight into what I was coding and helped
            me to visualise it better, resulting in much more efficient code and
            less debugging due to code logic not working as expected (Hunt &
            Thomas, 1999), than if I went into coding it without any sort of
            plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the things I would do to improve this code would be to do
            with making the code more efficient. For example, for the code that
            helps you enter and leave the to do board, instead of setting each
            object to true or false in the procedures it could instead do
            something like this, which would have dramatically reduced the
            amount of code needed for the class, increasing both efficiency and
            readability:
          </p>
          <code>
            <pre>
bool orderTF = false;

      void Start()
      {
        orderTF = false;
      }
      
      public void launch_orderboard()
      {
        if (orderboard.active == true)
        {
          orderTF = false;
        }
        else
        {
          orderTF = true;
        }
      }
      
      void Update()
      {
        orderboard.SetActive(orderTF);
        order1.SetActive(orderTF);
        ...
      }</pre
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            With this project, I was happy with how I fixed the randomiser to
            not be completely random, so that players couldn't get back to back
            repeats. However, in future I would like to spend more time thinking
            more about better ways to execute things in a more efficient
            fashion, which can be figured out a lot easier with things like the
            flowcharts that I used in this project. Therefore, I will continue
            to utilise these in planning my code in future. Another thing I
            think I could have improved on is my use of comments and try to use
            them more often in future.
