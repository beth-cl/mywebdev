      To make Potion Profiteer, we made the choice of using the unity engine
      over Unreal Engine 5 as The game has 4 coders on this project. As a result
      using Unity means that we can work more collaboratively using GitHub.
      Thanks to my introduction to Unity and C# programming, it made me one of
      the more experienced, leader coders of the 4 of us.

      In this project I have been tasked with coding the storefront. I used
      computational thinking to help code this as it helps to understand complex
      problems and create solutions. Therefore the first thing I did was
      decompose the problem by looking at the design draft. By using
      decomposition I could more easily tackle the code by dividing it into more
      understandable chunks. I think this was very useful as it helped to
      solidify my understanding on how to tackle the code and gave me a more
      solid understanding on what I am doing so I can therefore do it to a
      higher standard. However, one disadvantage is that this was a very simple
      decomposition and a may have missed things.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this division of the problem I have decided to work on the customer
      sprite first. This is because I feel it is the main function of the
      storefront. I decided to use a singular customer sprite that switched
      images to the different images of customers in a switch statement. I used
      a switch statement for two reasons. The first that it is more efficient
      than an if statement as the code will only read the case it needs rather
      than all the if statements. The second as it would be easier to randomise
      as a switch case, as random customers was one of the issues highlighted in
      the original decomposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this session I also tried to randomise the value of 'num' in the
      switch case. This proved to be more difficult then originally anticipated
      and so for the time being I left it as a simple switch case where 'num'
      increased by 1 at each key press and made sure that when it defaulted,
      'num' returned back to 0. I did this because I needed a way to bug check
      that the rest of my sprite change code was working and so I needed
      something to initiate that switch case.

                  case 0:

                      break;

                      num = 0;
                      break;
              }
          }
      }</code></pre>
    <p>
      To improve this code I could combine the "Public Sprite" initiations to be
      one line of code instead of 5. The void Start() can also be removed as it
      is unused in this class. Next I intend to make expand on this code to add
      a potion to interact with and a text to ask for the potion.
